## PURPOSE : TO PREDICT THE STOCK PRICE OF A COMPANY USING LSTM.
## ABOUT DATASET
### Google Stock Prediction

This dataset contains historical data of **Google's stock prices** and related attributes. It consists of 14 columns and a smaller subset of 1257 rows. Each column represents a specific attribute, and each row contains the corresponding values for that attribute.

The columns in the dataset are as follows:

1. **Symbol**: The name of the company, which is **GOOG** in this case.
2. **Date**: The year and date of the stock data.
3. **Close**: The closing price of Google's stock on a particular day.
4. **High**: The highest value reached by Google's stock on the given day.
5. **Low**: The lowest value reached by Google's stock on the given day.
6. **Open**: The opening value of Google's stock on the given day.
7. **Volume**: The trading volume of Google's stock on the given day, i.e., the number of shares traded.
